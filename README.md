## Journey to Coruscant
Greetings, young Padawan.  
To wield the full power of **skywalk.py**, you must first prepare your training grounds and channel the Force through the proper configurations. Follow these sacred steps carefully…

### ✨ **1. Install the Tools of the Jedi (Anaconda)**  
Before you can walk the Skywalker path, you must obtain the recent distribution known as **Anaconda**:  
🔗 https://www.anaconda.com/download  

Download it. Install it. Let it become one with your system.

### 🛠️ **2. Forge a New Conda Environment**  
Every Jedi must craft their own environment. Yours shall be known as **skywalkers**, forged in the fires of Python 3.11:

```
conda create -n skywalkers python=3.11
```

### 🧘 3. Awaken the Environment
```
conda activate skywalkers
```

### 🔑 4. Configure Your Holocrons (Slack Keys)
To communicate across the galaxy (i.e., Slack), prepare your encrypted holocrons:
* Place your Slack client authentication key into ```keys.json```.
* Store your channel ID within ```slack_channels.json```.

Treat them with the respect granted to all Jedi artifacts.

### 🚀 5. Execute the Skywalker Protocol
At last, it is time. Summon your clone commander and begin the mission:
```
python skywalk.py --clones REX --keys-file keys.json
```

## 🧘‍♂️ Pro Tip:
Not everyone needs to fight like a Sith. Some prefer the calm discipline of a Jedi Master.

Here’s a trading tip for those who move with patience and purpose:

> Divide your capital based on the number of peak signals identified in the weekly analysis for each stock.
> This way, you’re not swinging at every lightsaber flash — you’re allocating wisely, one high-probability move at a time. Less drama, more discipline. A true Jedi does not overtrade.
> Remember, A true Jedi doesn’t YOLO.
