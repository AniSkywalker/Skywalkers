## 🧘‍♂️ Pro Tip:
Not everyone needs to fight like a Sith. Some prefer the calm discipline of a Jedi Master.

Here’s a trading tip for those who move with patience and purpose:

Divide your capital based on the number of peak signals identified in the weekly analysis for each stock.

This way, you’re not swinging at every lightsaber flash — you’re allocating wisely, one high-probability move at a time. Less drama, more discipline. A true Jedi does not overtrade.

Remember, A true Jedi doesn’t YOLO.
